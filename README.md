# harmony-learning-analysis-app
Research and design of online video classroom and learning analysis App based on HarmonyOS

# Overview
This project aims to develop a comprehensive system that integrates online video classrooms with learning analytics technology on the HarmonyOS platform. The system will assess learners' performance through multidimensional data such as facial expressions, learning states, and screen usage duration. Additionally, it will establish an evaluative framework to quantify learners' progress, offering personalized teaching and learning solutions.

# Research Objectives
1. Develop a mobile application using HarmonyOS for online video teaching, emphasizing optimization of high-concurrency business structures.
2. Establish an evaluative framework for assessing learners' progress, allowing for quantifiable analysis and providing personalized teaching and learning solutions.
3. Capture external aspects of learners, such as facial expressions, study duration, and in-video exercises. Research ways to quantify user performance through data modeling, enabling accurate prediction and tailored services for students.

# Key Research Areas
1. Construction of Learner Evaluation System
  Explore methods for constructing a comprehensive and effective evaluation system based on learners' facial expressions, learning states, and screen usage duration.
